Registered interest will be reviewed by January 31, 2026, and selected contributors may be invited to participate more closely in the analysis and manuscript preparation for a paper planned for submission to Nature Scientific Data. 🤗",

    "content": "__Can LLMs Predict Their Own Failures? Self-Awareness via Internal Circuits__\nGhasemabadi, Amirhosein; Niu, Di\n<https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.20578>\n>>> Large language models (LLMs) generate fluent and complex outputs but often fail to recognize their own mistakes and hallucinations. Existing approaches typically rely on external judges, multi-sample consistency, or text-based self-critique, which incur additional compute or correlate weakly with true correctness. We ask: can LLMs predict their own failures by inspecting internal states during inference? We introduce Gnosis, a lightweight self-awareness mechanism that enables frozen LLMs to perform intrinsic self-verification by decoding signals from hidden states and attention patterns. Gnosis passively observes internal traces, compresses them into fixed-budget descriptors, and predicts correctness with negligible inference cost, adding only ~5M parameters and operating independently of sequence length. Across math reasoning, open-domain question answering, and academic knowledge benchmarks, and over frozen backbones ranging from 1.7B to 20B parameters, Gnosis consistently outperforms strong internal baselines and large external judges in both accuracy and calibration. Moreover, it generalizes zero-shot to partial generations, enabling early detection of failing trajectories and compute-aware control. These results show that reliable correctness cues are intrinsic to generation process and can be extracted efficiently without external supervision.",

Claude can then read, edit, or create files in that folder. \n\nOnce you've set a task, Claude makes a plan and steadily completes it, looping you in along the way. Claude will ask before taking any significant actions so you can course-correct as needed.\n\nClaude can use your existing connectors, which link Claude to external information. You can also pair Cowork with Claude in Chrome for tasks that need browser access. \n\nTry Cowork to re-organize your downloads, create a spreadsheet from a pile of screenshots, or produce a first draft from scattered notes.\n \nRead more: https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview\n\nCowork is available as a research preview for Claude Max subscribers in the macOS app. Click on “Cowork” in the sidebar.\n\nIf you're on another plan, join the waitlist for future access here: https://forms.gle/mtoJrd8kfYny29jQ9",
