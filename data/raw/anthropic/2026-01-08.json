This is a real obstacle for me.\n\nAdditionally, I have the impression that Claude does not reliably remember the project’s constraints once you open a new chat within the same project.\n\nI would be very grateful for help—especially on how to improve Claude’s “memory,” so that I can continue working on these complex workflows in a meaningful way with the AI, or so that working on them becomes truly feasible in the first place.\n\nBest regards from Berlin,\nFlo",

Max 5x user here, and when I never used to hit a weekly limit or even a session limit, I find myself hitting the limit every 5 hours, every time I start a new session I go up like 3%, ask it a few prompts, and poof I'm at 60% of my session limit in 30 minutes out of my 5 hour total.\n\nDon't even get me started on my weekly limit..\n\nAs a user paying $100/month, these limits are absurd, they just feel off. - Completely borked.\n\nToday was the first day since like December 21st, that I've been able to sit here and write code with claude for more than 30 minutes at a time, only because usage was temporarily broken so I full speed Opus and put balls to the walls",
