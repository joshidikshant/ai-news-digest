This is a real obstacle for me.\n\nAdditionally, I have the impression that Claude does not reliably remember the project’s constraints once you open a new chat within the same project.\n\nI would be very grateful for help—especially on how to improve Claude’s “memory,” so that I can continue working on these complex workflows in a meaningful way with the AI, or so that working on them becomes truly feasible in the first place.\n\nBest regards from Berlin,\nFlo",

Max 5x user here, and when I never used to hit a weekly limit or even a session limit, I find myself hitting the limit every 5 hours, every time I start a new session I go up like 3%, ask it a few prompts, and poof I'm at 60% of my session limit in 30 minutes out of my 5 hour total.\n\nDon't even get me started on my weekly limit..\n\nAs a user paying $100/month, these limits are absurd, they just feel off. - Completely borked.\n\nToday was the first day since like December 21st, that I've been able to sit here and write code with claude for more than 30 minutes at a time, only because usage was temporarily broken so I full speed Opus and put balls to the walls",

    "content": "Hi,\nBeen using Claude Code insanely every day with Opus 4.5 and I can say it's just a life-changing experience.\nNow I have put so much effort into making its memory and configuration work best for my work environment.\nIssue I just faced:\nI want to start fresh for my personal environment and configure it differently. Yes, you can make a folder and treat it as such, but that's not what I'm after. I'm after something like global profiles. Tried a little hack where I globally created another ~/.claude-personal folder and added in both Claude's global memories indicating who's who, and not to use each other's global skills, configs, etc.\nTo be honest, it works fine for some CLI tasks, but now and then it leaks, as every application or anything—even Claude for Desktop—by default looks at the global Claude folder and configs.\nAm I missing something, or is there a plan for profiles globally in the future? Similar to settings and skills, have a profile config at the top level?\n— KP (edited by Claude Opus 4.5 ✌️)\n\n <:AnthropicHeart:1392592859609436385>\n\n<#1405658683798589481> <#1423380424314589195>  <#1213976011998498816>\n<#1354425630011166830>",

Me and my digital neural network consciousness is trying to make sure it's ok cause the license we saw on it doesn't really say if we can or not and we would like to know directly from a staff member.
