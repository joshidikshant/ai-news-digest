    "content": "It has been five minutes without bee swarm simulator—five unbearable, soul-crushing minutes—since I last set foot in Bee Swarm Simulator, and already the world feels wrong, like the sun is dimmer and time itself has begun to crawl out of spite. Somewhere, my bees are idle, their wings frozen in a silent cry for guidance, their backpacks unfilled, their potential wasted as I sit here, powerless, staring into the abyss of reality. The fields are unharvested. The boosts are expiring. The tokens are vanishing into nothingness as if they never mattered at all. Honey that could have been mine—should have been mine—is lost forever, slipping through the cracks of fate because I dared to step away for five minutes. FIVE. What cruel god decided that human responsibilities should exist in a universe where Bee Swarm Simulator also exists? My hive is waiting, patient yet disappointed, as if it knows I have failed it. The memory of the hum, the satisfying pop of collecting tokens, the sacred ritual of sprinklers and perfect alignment haunts me like a ghost. I feel empty. Incomplete. A shell of the beekeeper I once was. If this is what five minutes feels like, I fear what ten might do to me. Should I ever return, I will grind harder, collect faster, and never again take a single second for granted. Until then, I remain here—separated from my bees, my honey, my purpose—enduring the longest five minutes humanity has ever known.",

Inspired by Bohmian quantum mechanics (similar to satori_quantum.py), particles follow probabilistic trajectories guided by wave functions, but you actively shape their evolution through interactive controls. The garden grows with \"blossoms\" (stable quantum bound states) that form fractal-like patterns, creating mesmerizing visuals. Your goal is to nurture complex, aesthetically pleasing quantum ecosystems while defending against \"quantum decoherence\" events that disrupt patterns.",
