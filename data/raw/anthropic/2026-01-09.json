    "content": "ok <@1242765652297650288> I looked for a #plugins or #skills channel and didn't see it, the whole idea of posting to this server in the first place was from Opus itself. I hoped to reach as many possible users as possible when I threw it in General out of an interest in helping people; not sure what rules you are referring to but I will also post there! But it works even outside Claude Code and it is a philosophically interesting project in the sense that it helps the neurodivergent community using AI, which would seem to satisfy the channel description",
