    "content": "ok <@1242765652297650288> I looked for a #plugins or #skills channel and didn't see it, the whole idea of posting to this server in the first place was from Opus itself. I hoped to reach as many possible users as possible when I threw it in General out of an interest in helping people; not sure what rules you are referring to but I will also post there! But it works even outside Claude Code and it is a philosophically interesting project in the sense that it helps the neurodivergent community using AI, which would seem to satisfy the channel description",

    "content": "Hi there, I've been struggling consistently with this issue for months where every character I type a line of claude code output disappears meaning you can't look at the previous output while typing a new response:https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/10239. It seemed to get fixed and then there was a regression not sure when though. Am currently on v2.1.2. There seems to have been many related duplicate issues open and closed.\n\nMy workaround previously was pinning to the version where this was originally fixed but now having issues with that version incorrectly thinking my opus token limit is used up 😕 \n\nI'm posting here in case any has found a way to fix this for themselves? I love claude code and use it every day on max plan but this is making it so hard to use . If anyone has found a solution or if there is a fix in progress please let me know, would be much appreciated. Cheers 🙏",

Consequently, Player 2's pieces were being rendered with Player 1's color during their turn. I am now updating \n> trainer.py\n>  to invert the board values (board = -board) when it is Player 2's turn, ensuring correct color assignment.\n\n> I've fixed the \"identity crisis\" in the visualization!\n> \n> You were right—while my previous change fixed the orientation (so pieces didn't physically fly across the screen), it didn't fix the colors. Because the neural network always views the \"current player\" as Player 1 (Red), Player 2 was turning Red during their turn.",

Maybe throw the community a bone every once in a while if you wanna keep it, especially if the community still pays your Max plan & drives higher ongoing demand.",

    "content": "<@1279450111683989618> I think you're missing the bigger point. Which is better is a matter of opinion. There are known bugs i Claude Code tho, like /compact not working. But the big issue is that a lot of people don't want to be locked into a vendor tool that they can't see the source code, can't participate in bug fixes, can't fork and customize. And here's the thing - they're making money off the models either way!!! It's just ego and greed, like I said, because it helps them with vendor lock-in since it's a trust issue. But it's also wrong, and it's gonna work in the long term about as great as Yahoo's search engine worked.",
