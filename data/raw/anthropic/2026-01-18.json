The claim that they \"compete with Claude Code\" is overstated for these resource-constrained models.`",

Claude's training + scale wins here.`\n\n```Can any one of these models match claude Opus, Sonnet or Haiku 4.5 capabilities by ANY means?Answer in a single paragraph\n-----\nSearching the web\n\n53 results\n\nNo open-source models running locally on modest hardware (like 4GB RAM setups) can fully match the capabilities of Claude Opus 4.5, Sonnet 4.5, or even Haiku 4.5 as of early 2026, primarily due to gaps in raw reasoning depth, agentic reliability, long-horizon planning, and polished system integration—Claude's proprietary training and optimizations give it a clear edge in complex coding, multi-step agents, and nuanced tasks (e.g., Opus 4.5 hits 80.9% on SWE-Bench Verified, outperforming rivals). However, by \"ANY means\"—such as using high-end hardware (hundreds of GB VRAM for large MoE models like Qwen3-Coder-480B or GLM-4.7), advanced quantization, or sophisticated agent frameworks (e.g., OpenCode, Cline, or Aider with RAG/retrieval)—top open-source models like GLM-4.7, DeepSeek-V3.2, Qwen-Max, Devstral 2, and Llama 4 variants can approximate or match Claude Sonnet/Haiku performance in many benchmarks and real-world coding/agentic scenarios, often at far lower cost and with full privacy/offline control, though they still trail Opus on the most demanding frontier tasks and require more engineering effort for equivalent polish.\n\n```\n\nAsked in the same chat",
