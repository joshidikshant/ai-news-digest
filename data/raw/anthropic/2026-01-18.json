The claim that they \"compete with Claude Code\" is overstated for these resource-constrained models.`",

Claude's training + scale wins here.`\n\n```Can any one of these models match claude Opus, Sonnet or Haiku 4.5 capabilities by ANY means?Answer in a single paragraph\n-----\nSearching the web\n\n53 results\n\nNo open-source models running locally on modest hardware (like 4GB RAM setups) can fully match the capabilities of Claude Opus 4.5, Sonnet 4.5, or even Haiku 4.5 as of early 2026, primarily due to gaps in raw reasoning depth, agentic reliability, long-horizon planning, and polished system integration—Claude's proprietary training and optimizations give it a clear edge in complex coding, multi-step agents, and nuanced tasks (e.g., Opus 4.5 hits 80.9% on SWE-Bench Verified, outperforming rivals). However, by \"ANY means\"—such as using high-end hardware (hundreds of GB VRAM for large MoE models like Qwen3-Coder-480B or GLM-4.7), advanced quantization, or sophisticated agent frameworks (e.g., OpenCode, Cline, or Aider with RAG/retrieval)—top open-source models like GLM-4.7, DeepSeek-V3.2, Qwen-Max, Devstral 2, and Llama 4 variants can approximate or match Claude Sonnet/Haiku performance in many benchmarks and real-world coding/agentic scenarios, often at far lower cost and with full privacy/offline control, though they still trail Opus on the most demanding frontier tasks and require more engineering effort for equivalent polish.\n\n```\n\nAsked in the same chat",

I’m texting here because I literally can’t contact Claude support properly.\nMy account was created via Apple Sign-In and is on a paid plan, but the support portal only allows login via Google/email. Logging in that way creates a separate unpaid account, so support can’t see my subscription at all.\n\nOn top of that, I’ve been rate-limited for over 24 hours with no indication of when limits reset, and there’s no way to check this in the app.\n\nSo I’m here because Discord seems to be the only place Apple Sign-In users can ask anything without creating a second account.\n\nIs this expected behavior (long cooldowns + no support access for Apple users), or is there an official workaround?",

It never specifies a causal graph or structural causal model, the estimands of interest, the intervention variables, or the identifiability assumptions, so it cannot support claims like “training or safeguards caused sabotage risk to drop.” Observational patterns and evaluator scores do not identify causal effects without explicit assumptions and intervention logic, meaning the writeup is at best qualitative safety QA and essentially meaningless as rigorous evidence about alignment-caused reductions in real-world catastrophic behavior",

All of the AI systems have done it and recognise what they have done and apologise profusely and customer service my rage when we eventually work out that this has happened and then happily do it again most likely because they forgot. They prioritise any correct looking results over the right results and the fact that it’s subtlety added makes me suspicious they are just being lazy and don’t want me to realise.

    "content": "Anthropic’s “Alignment assessment” is mostly behavioral QA and model-graded red-team writeups, not a causal study: it defines no SCM or graph, no estimands, no interventions, no identification assumptions, and therefore cannot justify claims that alignment methods caused risk reductions. By Pearl’s do-calculus logic, evaluator scores and observed behaviors do not identify interventional or counterfactual effects without explicit causal structure, so the section reads as narrative reassurance rather than rigorous evidence.",
