Claude Code is too constrained to trust it to run tools your going to waste way more resource to try to force a purposely limited system by design such as Claude Code to follow condition statements to run tools properly then it would even be worth. You're expecting Claude Code to be at a level where it could be but isn't because it's just that a coding tool. If you want Claude Code to provide you context on something just like a API to analyze something fine but to expect it to properly be conditioned and to have it replace direct API calls would be nonsense.",

A proc-macro crate for creating \"cheat-aware\" tests that document how they\n//! could be cheated and what the consequences would be for users.\n//!\n//! ## Why This Exists\n//!\n//!

    "content": "If outputs are verifiable, consistently high-quality, and bounded by known caveats that a knowledgeable user can quickly detect and correct, then usefulness is already demonstrated. This can exceed, in my opinion, the reliability we routinely accept from humans in narrow, technical domains.\n\nMost agents don’t meet that bar today, especially generic ones. Where systems like Claude Code stand out is not “intelligence” but the structure of their agentic loop- tighter feedback, better state tracking, and faster error convergence. That shifts them from demos into practical tools, even if they still require human oversight. \n\nThey may not be perfect machines, but neither are humans. If an AI’s error rate is comparable to a human’s in the same constrained task, the distinction becomes philosophical, not practical. Why is AI a \"toy\", but a human is a professional.\n\n\"Toy\" is overly dismissive, and largely, in my eyes, weakens your point. That kind of dismissive language oversimplifies the issue and weakens your argument. It’s also why I push back on it so hard. I couldn't tell if you were simply trolling, being philosophical, or trying to make a legitimate point in practicality not philosophy.",

Nevertheless, concerns persist regarding the accuracy and appropriateness of their generated content. A contemporary methodology, self-correction, has been proposed as a remedy to these issues. Building upon this premise, this paper critically examines the role and efficacy of self-correction within LLMs, shedding light on its true potential and limitations. Central to our investigation is the notion of intrinsic self-correction, whereby an LLM attempts to correct its initial responses based solely on its inherent capabilities, without the crutch of external feedback. In the context of reasoning, our research indicates that LLMs struggle to self-correct their responses without external feedback, and at times, their performance even degrades after self-correction. Drawing from these insights, we offer suggestions for future research and practical applications in this field.",

Let me be more systematic and try 724:\nActually, let me try 274 again but check clue 4 more carefully:\nFor 274 and clue 4 (162): 2 is in position 1 of our answer and position 3 of the clue. That's not \"well placed.\"\nThe answer should be 162 itself! Let me check:\n\n574: 6 and... wait, we determined 7 and 4 must both be in the answer.\n\nI think I need to restart completely.

Let me work through this systematically.\n\nFrom clue 2 (985: Nothing correct):\n\n9, 8, and 5 are NOT in the code\nFrom clue 1 (574: Two correct, one well-placed, one wrong position):\n\nSince 5 is out, the two correct numbers are 7 and 4\nOne is well-placed, one isn't\nFrom clue 3 (234: One correct and well-placed):\n\nSince 4 is confirmed in the code, and 3 needs checking...\nIf 4 were well-placed (position 3), that's our one correct here\nSo 2 and 3 are likely OUT\nFrom clue 4 (162: One correct and well-placed):\n\n2 is out (from above reasoning)\nSo either 1 or 6 is correct and well-placed\nPosition 1 = 1, Position 3 = 2... so if correct, 1 is in position 1 or 6 is in position 2\nFrom clue 5 (173: One correct but WRONG position):\n\n3 is out (from clue 3 reasoning)\n7 is in the code! But here it's in position 2, and it's WRONG position\nSo 7 is NOT in position 2 → 7 is in position 1 or 3\n1 is in position 1 here... if 1 were in the code, clue 4 says it's well-placed in position 1. But clue 5 says the correct number is in the WRONG position. So 1 is NOT in the code\nBack to clue 4: Since 1 is out, 6 is correct and in position 2\n\nPlacing 7: It's not in position 2 (clue 5). From clue 1, either 7 or 4 is well-placed. If 4 is in position 3 (well-placed from clue 3), then 7 must be the wrongly-placed one in clue 1 (position 2). But 6 is in position 2! So 7 goes in position 1.\n\nThe code: 764\n\nDid we match?",

But Vana asked it, and I think I agreed with it. She's not weird so it's okay, this is okay. I should keep this up.\" And I'm reading it like what is this??? :D",
