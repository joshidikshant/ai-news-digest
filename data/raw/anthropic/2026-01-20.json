Claude Code is too constrained to trust it to run tools your going to waste way more resource to try to force a purposely limited system by design such as Claude Code to follow condition statements to run tools properly then it would even be worth. You're expecting Claude Code to be at a level where it could be but isn't because it's just that a coding tool. If you want Claude Code to provide you context on something just like a API to analyze something fine but to expect it to properly be conditioned and to have it replace direct API calls would be nonsense.",
