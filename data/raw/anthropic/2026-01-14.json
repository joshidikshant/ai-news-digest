    "content": "__AutoCodeBench: Large Language Models are Automatic Code Benchmark Generators__\nChou, Jason; Liu, Ao; Deng, Yuchi; Zeng, Zhiying; Zhang, Tao; Zhu, Haotian; Cai, Jianwei; Mao, Yue; Zhang, Chenchen; Tan, Lingyun; Xu, Ziyan; Zhai, Bohui; Liu, Hengyi; Zhu, Speed; Zhou, Wiggin; Lian, Fengzong\n<https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09101>\n>>> Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various domains, with code generation emerging as a key area of focus. While numerous benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate their code generation abilities, these benchmarks face several critical limitations. First, they often rely on manual annotations, which are time-consuming and difficult to scale across different programming languages and problem complexities. Second, most existing benchmarks focus primarily on Python, while the few multilingual benchmarks suffer from limited difficulty and uneven language distribution. To address these challenges, we propose AutoCodeGen, an automated method for generating high-difficulty multilingual code generation datasets without manual annotations. AutoCodeGen ensures the correctness and completeness of test cases by generating test inputs with LLMs and obtaining test outputs through a multilingual sandbox, while achieving high data quality through reverse-order problem generation and multiple filtering steps. Using this novel method, we introduce AutoCodeBench, a large-scale code generation benchmark comprising 3,920 problems evenly distributed across 20 programming languages. It is specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on challenging, diverse, and practical multilingual tasks. We evaluate over 30 leading open-source and proprietary LLMs on AutoCodeBench and its simplified version AutoCodeBench-Lite. The results show that even the most advanced LLMs struggle with the complexity, diversity, and multilingual nature of these tasks. Besides, we introduce AutoCodeBench-Complete, specifically designed for base models",

I have a simple hook that runs after each submission that reminds claude to check if there is a skill availible that relates to the task before exicuting it.",

If anyone has time and wants to challenge/test it out, that would be awesome!\n\n**PULSE** is a safeguard framework for AI-assisted development (Cursor, Copilot, etc.). It prevents the classic AI coding disasters:\n\n🔑 **Secret Detection** – Catches API keys before you commit them\n🔄 **Loop Detection** – Stops you when you're stuck in fix-chains (editing the same file 5+ times)\n⏱️ **30-Minute Rule** – Auto-checkpoints so you never lose work\n🗑️ **Delete Guard** – Confirms before mass deletions\n📊 **Scope Tracking** – Visual progress bars showing how much you've changed\n\n**What makes it different:**\n- Works with Cursor's Agent Mode via MCP (Model Context Protocol)\n- The AI automatically calls safety checks before every response\n- VS Code extension with status bar timer\n- CLI commands for manual workflow\n\n**Built from real experience:** 14B+ tokens and 21K+ agentic sessions in 2025. This isn't theory – it's battle-tested.\n\n**Screenshots in the README** show exactly what it does (CLI output, agent chat, extension UI).\n\n🔗 **https://github.com/manuelfussTC/PulseFramework**\n\nWould love feedback, issues, PRs, or just a star if you think it's useful! 🙏",

Nevertheless, concerns persist regarding the accuracy and appropriateness of their generated content. A contemporary methodology, self-correction, has been proposed as a remedy to these issues. Building upon this premise, this paper critically examines the role and efficacy of self-correction within LLMs, shedding light on its true potential and limitations. Central to our investigation is the notion of intrinsic self-correction, whereby an LLM attempts to correct its initial responses based solely on its inherent capabilities, without the crutch of external feedback. In the context of reasoning, our research indicates that LLMs struggle to self-correct their responses without external feedback, and at times, their performance even degrades after self-correction. Drawing from these insights, we offer suggestions for future research and practical applications in this field.",
