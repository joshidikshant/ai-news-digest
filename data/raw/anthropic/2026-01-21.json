    "content": "I'm wondering if its possible to do the following. I'm completely in Apple-land (iPhone 15, last intel i9 Apple Macbook Pro made. 64GB RAM + 2.4GHz Intel i9 CPU), and an iPad Air 4th Gen. \n\nWhat I'm trying to do is work on the MBP (normally in iTerm2 with Claude Code running, with multiple MCPs like GitHub MCP, Context7, Sequential-Thinking, fetch) \n\nThen I'd like to be able to switch to the iPad and be able to bring up Claude in the browser (I use Chrome for iPad) and continue working from there. Lets say my 9yo daughter wants to play Roblox and I'm not near my MBP, so I pick up my iPhone and run the Claude app.\n\nBasically, I'd like to seamlessly be able to control the Claude session i have running on the MBP in iTerm2 from any one of these devices without having to figure out a shell that works on all 3 devices, configure SSH and lets say tmux or something similar.\n\nAm I out my gourd, or is something like this both possible and plausible?",

Totally doable so long as \n\nA) I use the remote rather than stdio versions of GitHub MCP and Context7\nB) I don't mind the loss of Sequential-Thinking local-only (stdio) plugin for Claude Code CLI (on MBP)\nC) I export work on the MBP via `&` prefix\n\nThe concern that became obvious was would the CLAUDE.md be ignored, or would it cause errors due to additionals not supported on some of the devices (like the non-negotiable mandates to use Sequential-Thinking and Plan mode by-default. Says it'd still be read, but selective-application of instructions based on relevance would happen. So no erroring out. \n\nSo, definitely some degradation but nothing materially significant enough to stop the workflow or cause crashing.",
