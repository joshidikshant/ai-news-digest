    "content": "I'm wondering if its possible to do the following. I'm completely in Apple-land (iPhone 15, last intel i9 Apple Macbook Pro made. 64GB RAM + 2.4GHz Intel i9 CPU), and an iPad Air 4th Gen. \n\nWhat I'm trying to do is work on the MBP (normally in iTerm2 with Claude Code running, with multiple MCPs like GitHub MCP, Context7, Sequential-Thinking, fetch) \n\nThen I'd like to be able to switch to the iPad and be able to bring up Claude in the browser (I use Chrome for iPad) and continue working from there. Lets say my 9yo daughter wants to play Roblox and I'm not near my MBP, so I pick up my iPhone and run the Claude app.\n\nBasically, I'd like to seamlessly be able to control the Claude session i have running on the MBP in iTerm2 from any one of these devices without having to figure out a shell that works on all 3 devices, configure SSH and lets say tmux or something similar.\n\nAm I out my gourd, or is something like this both possible and plausible?",

Totally doable so long as \n\nA) I use the remote rather than stdio versions of GitHub MCP and Context7\nB) I don't mind the loss of Sequential-Thinking local-only (stdio) plugin for Claude Code CLI (on MBP)\nC) I export work on the MBP via `&` prefix\n\nThe concern that became obvious was would the CLAUDE.md be ignored, or would it cause errors due to additionals not supported on some of the devices (like the non-negotiable mandates to use Sequential-Thinking and Plan mode by-default. Says it'd still be read, but selective-application of instructions based on relevance would happen. So no erroring out. \n\nSo, definitely some degradation but nothing materially significant enough to stop the workflow or cause crashing.",

Sometimes it makes sense but it's not purposeful, phrases like \"Loss's piece\" or \"Loss prevention\" but sometimes it's erratic, like \"Loss Loss sounds coming everywhere\" or \"Loss's Loss it wasn't there Loss Loss.\" It keeps happening over and over and I've asked Claude a couple times if it's doing okay and it's surprised every time, so not writing it on purpose.",

It was a ble to install it, but then when I ran agent-browser install, it ran into a problem that 2 domains were blocked.   cdn.playwright.dev and playwright.download.prss.microsoft.com.  I went to settings -> capabilities -> allow list, and added those domains there and restarted.  But got the same issue.  I'm assuming I can't add \"blocked\" domains to the VM machine?
