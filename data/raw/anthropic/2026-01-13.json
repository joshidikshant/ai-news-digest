Is there any way to package rules or a CLAUDE.md from within the plugin so that it automatically gets added to memory after install?\n\nAt the moment, I have a `general-wasp-knowledge.md` doc and a `/wasp:init` slash command that comes with the plugin. The idea is to use the `SessionStart` hook to alert the user to run this command, which just adds an import line to the `general-wasp-knowledge.md` doc in their CLAUDE.md file:\n```md\n  ⎿  SessionStart:startup says:\n    \n     IMPORTANT! The Wasp plugin hasn't been initialized for the current project.\n     Run /wasp:init to get the plugin's full functionality -- or reply \"opt out\" to never see this message again. \n```\n\nI'm wondering if this is a bad practice, or if there's a more efficient way to achieve this result?",
