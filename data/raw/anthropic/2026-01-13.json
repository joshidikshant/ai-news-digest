Is there any way to package rules or a CLAUDE.md from within the plugin so that it automatically gets added to memory after install?\n\nAt the moment, I have a `general-wasp-knowledge.md` doc and a `/wasp:init` slash command that comes with the plugin. The idea is to use the `SessionStart` hook to alert the user to run this command, which just adds an import line to the `general-wasp-knowledge.md` doc in their CLAUDE.md file:\n```md\n  ⎿  SessionStart:startup says:\n    \n     IMPORTANT! The Wasp plugin hasn't been initialized for the current project.\n     Run /wasp:init to get the plugin's full functionality -- or reply \"opt out\" to never see this message again. \n```\n\nI'm wondering if this is a bad practice, or if there's a more efficient way to achieve this result?",

The system is not recognizing the standard commands I would normally use to update artifacts.\n\nIt's not a particularly large file. 88 lines, 18k. I even tried to DL it and UL it to a new chat to clear context, and it still won't update it as an artifact it wants to write markdown in the chat window.

It can be extremely loquacious if you ask it to be or if you demonstrate that you'd like it to be, but lacking any specific guidance, it'll default to an inoffensive median personality. In terms of hallucinations, the term is a little vaguely defined, but, yes, it can get worse with larger contexts. In the specific context of creative writing, the tricky thing is that controlled hallucination is actually often what you want; coming up with plausibly fitting concepts that aren't grounded in any sort of external facts, but fit overall patterns for the narrative you're trying to tell. Claude leans more toward the less creative side, I believe largely because it's so optimized for coding. Most models are being tuned this way currently.",

OPUS (Design, Delegate prompts (via MD or an A2A infrastucture), sequentual or parallel decision up to OPUS.\n2. Sonnet agent per prompt build the entire product and unit test.\n3. OPUS (having context of the design and delegation)  now Validates the work of Sonnets, and catches the dropped balls.\n4. Switch overseer (from OPUS to Sonnet) and leverage the entire design, delegation and fixes session history into generating all your documentation, and development logs.\n-----\n\nThis approach allows you to leverage OPUS to churn out a full production-grade product in one go. if you don't use persistent memory like me, it's a good idea to output your designs into MD files and request illustrations (if the product is frontend UX) and iterate over MD files, thus you have more control over the data iteration un-muddied from the rest of the conversation).\n\n\n🙂 I hope that helps pal!  happy to help if you have deeper questions on how OPUS works!",
