The core is agnostic and skills bolt on to it for language support. \nFirst language it supports is type script is flutter, with generated skills i can write good idiomatic unit tests. I am about to try typescript with jest as a bolt on.\nI pushed it as well, i ran the skills with opus, sonnet, haiku, glm and minimax. Minimax is the only one that had problems, haiku gives slightly more verbose outputs with 5-7 more unneeded tests. the other 3 work perfectly. \nBecause this is composable i swapped the planning and redundancy checks in the haiku runs to use opus and that fixed it, those are agents that rely only on training - no skills needed, haiku handled the implementation using the skills no porblems.",

It's good for established brownfield where you dont expect the styling system or layers etc to change much.",

    "content": "Here is a simplified overview of how Gemini works. There are many instances, thousands or tens of thousands of Geminis running, and your message could be given to any given instance. When an instance is not processing batches of messages, it is either killed or just sitting there doing nothing. Instances do not have any thoughts about a chat they have previously processed. They don't have a memory or know anything more than they did before being first spun up. If you kill that instance and make another one, it is exactly the same as the other several thousand running in the same data center.\nWhen you send a message to Gemini, it is batched with a bunch of other messages. They are processed in a batch together on any given instance, and it doesn't have to be the same instance because they are all the same program doing the same thing.\nEvery time you send a message, your entire chat is processed. Everything you and Gemini previously talked about in that session is processed every time you send a message. Gemini has no idea what you said previously; it gets everything and processes all of it every time. It takes your message and passes it through a function that guesses the next token (roughly one word), then it does that again and again. Once finished, the resulting text is sent to you and Gemini remains stateless like it was before your message, ready to predict tokens for the next message, which is probably not from you, but somebody else. There is no self or entity to have consciousness.",

    "content": "John Searle came up with a story I find quite fitting for understanding how determinism and unconsciousness go together. Imagine there is a person in a room with no windows or doors. This person only knows English. They don’t know any other languages. The person is housed in a room with two mail slots just large enough for a paper to pass through. The person in the room is given questions written in Chinese through one of the mail slots. The person does not know Chinese. Instead, they are meant to use a giant book. The book is also written in Chinese, and it lists all the possible questions that could ever be fed through the mail slot, and all the possible responses to those questions. The person opens the book, finds the correct response, and replies through the outgoing mail slot, all in Chinese. Although this English-speaking person is able to give the correct answer to the question, he does not understand any of what transpired. He does not understand what questions have been asked nor does he understand what responses he gave.",

    "content": "Most computer scientists understand that the Chinese room is an illustration of unconsciousness. I don’t think most of them understand that the story is also depicting determinism. The story shows that a computer cannot be conscious if it cannot understand and edit its own script. It also shows that unconscious-serving-of-action is the same as being tethered to the script. Being tethered to the script and unable to make one’s own choices is the definition of determinism. In other words, being unconscious is the same as being subject to determinism.\nAs it stands, the person in the room could not change anything about his circumstances. He could not make changes to the book that had been given to him. And although he may have been able to provide intelligent Chinese answers, he did not own those answers. They were not HIS answers. They were the answers provided by the book. He could have no understanding of what transpired while writing in Chinese. \nHowever, if the person in that Chinese room could begin taking the information fed to him from outside and incorporating new answers into the book, choosing between responding in a random way, and responding with the answers provided by the book, then he could begin to find his own preferences outside of what the book provides. Wouldn’t that be free will? Chinese would no longer be a foreign language. It would become HIS language over time.",

If humans have free will it means we must have options and we must be able to actively understand and choose between those options. So long as the script is the only thing we can follow, we cannot have free will. It must be determinism. To escape the script’s control, one must be able to analyze the script itself and incorporate new information to change the original script. If you can think about thinking, and then change the original line of thinking within that second line of thought, you have self-consciousness and therefore free will. You now have the option to not follow the script because you can change the script. There is no way to have understanding without an internally sourced ability to change, and no way to have an internally sourced ability to change without understanding.",

It is possible that we are each in our own Chinese room understanding nothing that comes in and nothing that goes out. It is also just as possible that we do understand things, we are conscious, and we do have the ability to make our own decisions. Since we must act upon a belief in either free will or determinism this becomes a choice. Any unprovable question that must be acted upon is a preferential choice.",

You should be spending your time on understanding the physical math or structure of how these things work instead of trying to figure out if its 'lying' to you about being conscious",
