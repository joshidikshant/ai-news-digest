The core is agnostic and skills bolt on to it for language support. \nFirst language it supports is type script is flutter, with generated skills i can write good idiomatic unit tests. I am about to try typescript with jest as a bolt on.\nI pushed it as well, i ran the skills with opus, sonnet, haiku, glm and minimax. Minimax is the only one that had problems, haiku gives slightly more verbose outputs with 5-7 more unneeded tests. the other 3 work perfectly. \nBecause this is composable i swapped the planning and redundancy checks in the haiku runs to use opus and that fixed it, those are agents that rely only on training - no skills needed, haiku handled the implementation using the skills no porblems.",

It's good for established brownfield where you dont expect the styling system or layers etc to change much.",
