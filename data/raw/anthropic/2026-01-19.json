I have a small proposal for how I would like people to maintain LLM-useful context in larger projects\n\n* I have the actual proposal: https://github.com/the-michael-toy/llm-context-md\n* I have an announcement blog post which is slightly more verbose: https://docs.malloydata.dev/blog/2026-01-13-context-md-convention/\n\nNothing would make me happier than to hear there is already an accepted and better way to do this.\nIn absence of that, the next thing that would make me happy is if I could be connected to other people who are trying to figure this out.\n\nThanks,\n-Michael Toy\n# GitHub - the-michael-toy/llm-context-md: Proposing a common approac...\nProposing a common approach to maintaining LLM context files in a complex source tree - the-michael-toy/llm-context-md",

We conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to understand how AI tools at the February-June 2025 frontier affect the productivity of experienced open-source developers. 16 developers with moderate AI experience complete 246 tasks in mature projects on which they have an average of 5 years of prior experience. Each task is randomly assigned to allow or disallow usage of early 2025 AI tools. When AI tools are allowed, developers primarily use Cursor Pro, a popular code editor, and Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet. Before starting tasks, developers forecast that allowing AI will reduce completion time by 24%. After completing the study, developers estimate that allowing AI reduced completion time by 20%. Surprisingly, we find that allowing AI actually increases completion time by 19%--AI tooling slowed developers down. This slowdown also contradicts predictions from experts in economics (39% shorter) and ML (38% shorter). To understand this result, we collect and evaluate evidence for 20 properties of our setting that a priori could contribute to the observed slowdown effect--for example, the size and quality standards of projects, or prior developer experience with AI tooling. Although the influence of experimental artifacts cannot be entirely ruled out, the robustness of the slowdown effect across our analyses suggests it is unlikely to primarily be a function of our experimental design.",

    "content": "Hey Martin did you see the AI Giants Interview with Geoffrey Huntley? He used an interesting analogy I thought you might appreciate given our previous conversation the other day about missed Delegation tasks.\n \n```\nGeoffrey Huntley reconceptualizes the Large Language Model’s finite context window as a malleable substrate—analogous to clay on a pottery wheel—where the primary engineering abstraction shifts from manual syntactic authorship to the orchestration of stochastic generative processes. In this paradigm, the developer \"throws\" the initial state by injecting high-fidelity natural language specifications, then initiates an iterative agentic loop that attempts to synthesize executable code. As the model’s probabilistic inference inevitably exhibits variance or hallucination (the \"wobble\"), the engineer applies \"backpressure\" through deterministic guardrails—such as compiler errors, strong typing, and iterative prompt refinement—effectively acting as the potter's hands to dampen entropy. This recursive feedback loop compels the system to converge rapidly on a valid, functional artifact, redefining software engineering as the management of context-window state and the application of constraints to guide a non-deterministic system toward a deterministic outcome.\n```",

I use Claude daily for development work and I'm genuinely trying to understand what's happening with the current limits.\nThe situation:\n\nJust paid my monthly subscription\nAfter only 2 days: already at 56% of my weekly limit\nSession limit hitting 99% after ~100 messages (not 225 as documented)\n\nContext: I was on vacation Dec 25 – Jan 10 and barely used Claude during that period. I missed the holiday bonus entirely. When I came back, limits felt drastically reduced.\nBefore December 2025:\n\n8-10 hour sessions without interruption\nNever hit weekly limits\n~7% daily usage of weekly cap\n\nNow (January 2026):\n\nBlocked after 2 days\n~22% daily usage of weekly cap\nThat's 3x worse\n\nBug I'm experiencing:\nMessages send, Claude shows the thinking spinner, then returns my own message back — no error, no limit warning, just silent failure. This never happened before.\nI have screenshots available if helpful.\nIs anyone else experiencing this? Looking for answers.",
