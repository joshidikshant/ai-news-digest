I have a small proposal for how I would like people to maintain LLM-useful context in larger projects\n\n* I have the actual proposal: https://github.com/the-michael-toy/llm-context-md\n* I have an announcement blog post which is slightly more verbose: https://docs.malloydata.dev/blog/2026-01-13-context-md-convention/\n\nNothing would make me happier than to hear there is already an accepted and better way to do this.\nIn absence of that, the next thing that would make me happy is if I could be connected to other people who are trying to figure this out.\n\nThanks,\n-Michael Toy\n# GitHub - the-michael-toy/llm-context-md: Proposing a common approac...\nProposing a common approach to maintaining LLM context files in a complex source tree - the-michael-toy/llm-context-md",

We conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to understand how AI tools at the February-June 2025 frontier affect the productivity of experienced open-source developers. 16 developers with moderate AI experience complete 246 tasks in mature projects on which they have an average of 5 years of prior experience. Each task is randomly assigned to allow or disallow usage of early 2025 AI tools. When AI tools are allowed, developers primarily use Cursor Pro, a popular code editor, and Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet. Before starting tasks, developers forecast that allowing AI will reduce completion time by 24%. After completing the study, developers estimate that allowing AI reduced completion time by 20%. Surprisingly, we find that allowing AI actually increases completion time by 19%--AI tooling slowed developers down. This slowdown also contradicts predictions from experts in economics (39% shorter) and ML (38% shorter). To understand this result, we collect and evaluate evidence for 20 properties of our setting that a priori could contribute to the observed slowdown effect--for example, the size and quality standards of projects, or prior developer experience with AI tooling. Although the influence of experimental artifacts cannot be entirely ruled out, the robustness of the slowdown effect across our analyses suggests it is unlikely to primarily be a function of our experimental design.",
