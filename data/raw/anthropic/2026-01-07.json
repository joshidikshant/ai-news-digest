Users on Reddit have noted that the \"Usage\" tab in both Claude Desktop and the web interface no longer shows usage statistics, and the /usage command in the CLI returns an error indicating a permission issue with the OAuth token scope.\n Some users have observed that while the usage tab is inaccessible, they still receive warnings about reaching 75% or 80% of their weekly limits directly in the terminal, suggesting that tracking is still active but not visible through the standard interface.\n This issue appears to have started recently, with reports emerging on January 7, 2026, and is affecting both free and paid users.\n Additionally, there are ongoing concerns about sudden changes in usage consumption, with some users reporting that their usage is being consumed at an accelerated rate, possibly due to a bug or unintended change in how tokens are calculated.\n These reports suggest that while usage tracking may still be functional, the visibility and reliability of usage data are currently compromised.\n```",
