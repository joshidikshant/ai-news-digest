I have a couple of suggestions for improving the Claude.ai chat interface, specifically for Projects:\n1. \"Select All\" checkbox for project files\nWhen working with projects that have many files, it would be really helpful to have a \"Select All\" checkbox to include all files in the conversation at once. Currently, you have to click each file individually, which is tedious. I actually had to write my own browser extension to work around this.\n2. Replace file option\nIt would be great to have the ability to replace a file in a project directly, instead of having to delete it and re-upload a new version.\nThat's it - thanks for reading!",

    "content": "The Ralph Wiggum technique originated from Jeffrey Huntley as a simple bash loop that kept re-prompting Claude until tasks were complete, and Anthropic later released an official ralph-wiggum plugin for Claude Code . The technique works by using a Stop hook that intercepts Claude’s exit attempts and creates a self-referential feedback loop, preventing Claude from ending sessions until it outputs a specific completion promise . The plugin enables autonomous development loops where each iteration adds context from previous attempts, allowing Claude to learn from failures automatically without human intervention . Critics note that Anthropic’s official implementation can be fragile, dying in cryptic ways and missing the original technique’s key insight of carving work into independent context windows rather than just running forever . The Ralph technique’s viral popularity in late December 2025 and early January 2026 coincided with Anthropic cracking down on third-party tools like OpenCode that were using subscription OAuth tokens to access Claude outside official channels .",
