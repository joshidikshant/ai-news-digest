I have a couple of suggestions for improving the Claude.ai chat interface, specifically for Projects:\n1. \"Select All\" checkbox for project files\nWhen working with projects that have many files, it would be really helpful to have a \"Select All\" checkbox to include all files in the conversation at once. Currently, you have to click each file individually, which is tedious. I actually had to write my own browser extension to work around this.\n2. Replace file option\nIt would be great to have the ability to replace a file in a project directly, instead of having to delete it and re-upload a new version.\nThat's it - thanks for reading!",
