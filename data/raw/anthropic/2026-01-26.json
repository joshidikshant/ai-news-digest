Now, those tools show up right in the conversation, so you can see what's happening and collaborate in real time. \n\nDraft, format and send messages in Slack, visualize ideas as Figma diagrams, or build and update project timelines on Asana—all without switching tabs.\n\nAlso available for Amplitude, Box, Canva, Clay, Hex, and Monday. com. See all interactive tools: https://claude.com/blog/interactive-tools-in-claude\n\nAvailable on web and desktop for all paid plans. Coming soon to Claude Cowork.\n\nGet started at https://claude.ai/directory.",
