And don't worry, help is just a support ticket away... or several days, who's counting?

🚨 Pump the brakes on feature frenzy!

In the race to innovate, tech companies often forget the basics: keeping their users happy. Recently, Claude users have found themselves hitting usage limits faster than expected, followed by enforced lockouts. Add in slow or unresponsive support, and you've got a recipe for frustration, especially when the subscription costs are anything but low.

Here's the kicker: While Anthropic is rolling out shiny new features, a growing number of users are left wondering if customer satisfaction has taken a backseat. Could it be that in the rush to outdo competitors, the essentials—like responsive support and seamless usage—are being overlooked?

Are we witnessing a classic case of "features over fundamentals"? If so, what's the real cost of prioritizing new bells and whistles over the foundational needs of loyal customers?

✨ Are we too focused on the next big thing, forgetting to perfect what we already have? How do you think tech companies should balance innovation with user satisfaction? Share your thoughts!
