🚨 Feature Frenzy: Are We Trading Stability for Innovation? 🚨

In the fast-paced world of tech, the mantra seems to be "innovate or die." But with the recent launch of Claude's Cowork beta, many users are encountering the dreaded "Conversation not found" errors. Is this a simple hiccup in the system, or are we witnessing a broader trend where the race to release new features is leading to platform instability?

The tech community thrives on agility and adaptation, but are we sacrificing too much in the process? As we eagerly anticipate what's next on the horizon, it's worth considering: should stability take precedence over the allure of the shiny new feature? 

What do you think? Is the current pace of innovation sustainable, or should we slow down to ensure a more reliable user experience? Let's rethink how we balance the equation between progress and performance. 👇
