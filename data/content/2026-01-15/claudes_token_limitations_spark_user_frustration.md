🚨 Breaking: Does Claude's Token Limit Really Spell Doom for Opus 4.5? 🚨

As the dust settles on Opus 4.5's latest release, a wave of frustration is sweeping across the user community. Many Pro plan users are finding themselves hitting token limits faster than anticipated, with some alleging the platform is now "simply unusable." What was once a powerhouse of potential seems to be throttled by its own constraints.

The reality? Pro users are reportedly capped at a mere 16 prompts per week. For a tool marketed on efficiency and convenience, this limitation is not just a speed bump—it's a roadblock. How can creators fully explore new possibilities when they're constantly counting down to zero?

Here's the contrarian take: Instead of seeing this as a setback, could this token limitation actually drive more creativity and precision? Constraints often breed innovation, pushing users to maximize output from every single prompt. 

Is this the moment that forces Opus users to rethink and refine their approach? Or is it the breaking point for those who feel their creative flow is being strangled by numbers? Let’s discuss: Are limitations the mother of invention or the curtain call for user loyalty? 🤔🔍
