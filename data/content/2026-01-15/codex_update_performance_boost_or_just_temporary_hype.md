🚨 Codex just got a speed boost and everyone's losing their minds. But remember, last time we thought we were cruising in a Ferrari, it turned into a Prius by week 2. 🤨

🚀 Codex has turbocharged our workflows with its latest update, but is this just another temporary high?

The latest buzz in the coding community is the noticeable performance boost in Codex. Users everywhere are raving about increased speed and efficiency. But here's a thought that might burst the bubble—does history suggest we're on a rollercoaster of initial excitement followed by the inevitable plateau?

Remember past updates where the initial surge felt like the future had arrived, only for the sheen to wear off as we settled back into familiar patterns? This contrarian take isn't about being a downer, but a reminder to temper our excitement with a bit of skepticism.

So, is Codex's new speed here to stay, or is history doomed to repeat itself? Consider how we can not only measure immediate success but also ensure these enhancements persist. What strategies can we employ to turn this potential flash in the pan into a sustainable fire? 🔥
