🚨 Think Claude's project management features are perfect? Think again! 🚨

While Claude has made strides in streamlining our workflow, it's the users bringing the *real* innovation to the table. Let's talk about some game-changing suggestions from the community that could take Claude to the next level. The proposed "Select All" checkbox for project files is a no-brainer for efficiency, and a file replacement feature could save us all from the tedious re-uploading dance. 

Here's the kicker: Why weren't these features already part of the package? It's a reminder that sometimes, the users have a keener sense of practicality than the developers themselves. It’s a lesson in humility and a call to listen more closely to the voices that use the software daily.

Are we relying enough on user insights to drive innovation, or are we too often married to our vision of what the product *should* be? Share your thoughts! 🚀
