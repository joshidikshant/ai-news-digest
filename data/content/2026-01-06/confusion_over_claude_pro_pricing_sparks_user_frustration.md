🚨 Subscription Overload: Why Is My $17 Plan Costing $200?! 🚨

In the age of "easy" subscriptions, sometimes they aren't all that easy. Recently, users have been up in arms about unexpected charges for Claude Pro – imagine budgeting for a $17/month plan and being slapped with a $200 bill! That's not just a hiccup; it's a full-blown headache.

While companies chase innovative pricing strategies, are they inadvertently crafting mazes that users struggle to navigate?
