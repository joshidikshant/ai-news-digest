🚀 Ever thought that your AI could have a better memory than your coding partner? Let's change that.

Michael Toy is stirring the pot with a groundbreaking proposal: a standardized approach for maintaining context files, making large language models (LLMs) more effective in complex source trees. Imagine an open-source world where integrating an LLM is as seamless as a git pull. This could be a game-changer, not just for developers, but for AI progress as a whole.

Now, here's the curveball: What if standardizing LLM context files actually hinders creativity? Some argue that imposing a structure might limit the flexibility that fuels innovation. Yet, there's a compelling case for how it could reduce cognitive load and enhance productivity.

Could this proposal be the missing link in our quest for smarter AI integration into open-source projects? Or is there a risk of stifling the creative chaos that drives revolutionary ideas? Share your thoughts and let's reimagine the future of AI and open-source together. 🤔💡
