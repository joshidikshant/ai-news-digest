🚨 BREAKING: Grok 4.20, the highly anticipated AI model, may just be the Windows Vista of its kind! 🤯

Despite all the buzz and hype, Grok 4.20 underperforms when stacked against Opus, especially when it comes to handling Tailwind. This is a letdown for developers who were eagerly anticipating a game-changer. It's more like a re-run of the same old script, with a few bells and whistles.

But here's a contrarian take: Are we focusing too much on the new and shiny, rather than optimizing existing tech like Opus, which continues to deliver reliable results? Sometimes, the pursuit of innovation can blind us to the potential of the tools already at our fingertips.

As we navigate the ever-evolving landscape of AI, are we asking the right questions? Should we be chasing the next big release, or focusing on mastering the tools we already have? Share your thoughts below! 🧐
