🚨 Is your AI assistant ghosting you? 

If you're a Windows user, chances are you've encountered the Claude Desktop app mysteriously transforming into a blank, empty window. It's an odd issue, leaving many users scratching their heads while Mac users continue to chat away without a hitch. 

This raises an intriguing question: Why do cross-platform discrepancies persist in AI applications, and how can developers ensure equal stability across operating systems? With more businesses relying on AI tools, consistency in performance isn't just a nice-to-have—it's a necessity.

But here's the twist: Instead of patching isolated issues, should developers be rethinking the entire framework for cross-platform AI applications? 🤔 

What other underlying issues might we be overlooking in the quest for cross-platform harmony?
