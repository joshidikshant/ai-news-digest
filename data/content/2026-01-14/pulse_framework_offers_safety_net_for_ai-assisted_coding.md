🚨 AI coding is great—until it isn’t. Have you ever watched in horror as your AI assistant blissfully loops into oblivion? 😱

Enter the PULSE Framework, a game-changer for AI-assisted coding. Designed to be the safety net we didn’t know we needed, it offers essential safeguards like secret detection and infinite loop detection. PULSE aims not just to enhance workflow efficiency, but also to ensure your code remains secure and robust.

Sure, AI has revolutionized how we code, but let’s face it, putting blind faith in it can lead to some spectacular fails. That's where PULSE comes into play, aiming to prevent these common pitfalls and provide a safety-first approach to your development process.

Yet, the real question remains: should the responsibility of building secure and efficient software lie with AI, or should it remain a human endeavor with AI as an aid? How do you see the role of AI in your coding journey evolving? 🤔
