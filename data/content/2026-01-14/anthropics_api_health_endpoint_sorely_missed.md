🔥 Why isn't every API equipped with a health endpoint? Anthropic, we're looking at you! 🚀

As developers, we're constantly navigating the unpredictable seas of API integration, and without a health endpoint, it's like sailing blind. Many users have voiced their frustrations over Anthropic's API lacking this critical feature. The absence of real-time status updates doesn't just inconvenience us — it leaves us speculating in the dark.

Sure, some might argue that constant monitoring and robust error handling can mitigate these issues. But isn't this akin to patching a leaking boat with duct tape? Every API deserves a health endpoint, not just for transparency but to fortify trust and streamline our workflows.

So let's flip the script: should health endpoints be seen as an optional luxury or an indispensable necessity in today's API-driven world? Let's challenge the norm and rethink our approach to API design. 🌟
