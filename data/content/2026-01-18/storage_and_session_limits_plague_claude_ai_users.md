🚨 Is Claude AI ready for primetime, or are its storage woes keeping it in the sandbox?

While AI continues to dazzle us with its prowess, Claude AI users are hitting a roadblock: files over 200KB seem to be its kryptonite. In an era where we can store terabytes in our back pocket, why is a sophisticated AI struggling with something so... basic?

Compounding the issue are session limits that turn the AI experience into a game of stop-and-go. When efficiency should be the name of the game, constant disruptions are leaving users frustrated and questioning whether Claude AI is truly prepared for the fast-paced demands of 2026.

But here's the kicker—perhaps these limitations aren't just bugs, but features that reveal deeper design philosophies, or even security protocols. Could it be that Claude AI is intentionally designed with these constraints to safeguard against data overload or misuse?

So, where do we draw the line between innovation and practicality? Should AI prioritize limitless potential or fundamental reliability? Your thoughts? 👇
