🚨 Breaking News: Claude Code just switched its default model from Opus to Sonnet—time to rethink your AI game plan! 🎯

As developers, we often rely on default settings to streamline our workflow. But what happens when those defaults suddenly change? With Claude Code's latest update (v2.1.3), the switch to the Sonnet model is shaking things up. Sonnet promises enhanced performance and nuanced understanding, but will it deliver on its promises, or is it just a sophisticated way to disrupt our systems?

Here's the kicker: While many may rush to embrace this shiny new model, it's worth considering whether this shift aligns with your project's unique needs. The default model may be touted as the new standard, but it might not be the best fit for your particular use case. Sometimes, sticking with what you know—Opus, in this case—might offer more stability and familiarity, especially if your team has already optimized for it.

So, are you ready to dive into Sonnet's potential, or will you stick to the tried-and-true Opus? 💡 How do you decide when to adopt new technology, and when to hold your ground? Let's hear your thoughts! 👇
