💥 Why is Claude Pro Max's code terminal mode saying, "I'm outta here!" more than a stressed-out employee? 💥

If you’ve been pulling your hair out with persistent timeout errors while using Claude Pro Max's code terminal mode, you’re not alone. Users have been buzzing about these frustrating interruptions, causing many to rethink their workflow. Meanwhile, Claude's VSCode extension seems to be sailing smoothly. So why the disparity?
