🚀 Is Claude sneaking in extra calories while you’re not looking? 

We've all heard the chatter about increased token usage recently, and it's not just coming from the heavyweights in AI. Even light users have been raising their eyebrows at the unexpected jump in tokens spent. This shift suggests there might be more to the story than meets the eye.

Some argue that Claude is becoming more resource-intensive, demanding more tokens for the same tasks. But here's the twist: could it be that we're simply pushing the limits of what AI can do, thus inadvertently hiking up resource consumption? After all, more complex queries and creative uses naturally consume more tokens.

Before we jump to conclusions, let's pause: Is Claude's increased appetite a sign of inefficiency, or are we just getting hungrier for innovation? 🤔 Let’s hear your thoughts.
