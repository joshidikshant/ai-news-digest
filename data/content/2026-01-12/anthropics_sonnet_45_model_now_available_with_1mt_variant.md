🚀 Is Sonnet 4.5 the AI model your business needs, or just another high-cost hype?

Anthropic's latest Sonnet 4.5 model, now offering a 1MT variant, is turning heads—but not necessarily wallets. While the model promises enhanced capabilities and is accessible to all via API, it's the price tag that has heads spinning. For most, this cutting-edge technology is realistically within reach only for enterprise giants with deep pockets.

Here's a contrarian take: Is Anthropic's premium pricing strategy a misstep? By focusing on enterprise affordability, they risk alienating smaller innovators who could drive widespread adoption and creative use cases. Are they missing out on the long-tail potential of smaller businesses that could fuel exponential growth? 

With this in mind, is the future of AI innovation going to be dominated by those who can afford to pay for it, or could a more inclusive pricing model lead to broader advancements? How do you think Anthropic should navigate this balance? 🤔 #AI #Innovation #BusinessStrategy
