🚨 Stop scrolling! What if I told you that AI isn't just the future of productivity, but also a ticking time bomb for cybersecurity?

Thanks to Radware, we now know about a zero-click vulnerability in ChatGPT's Deep Research agent. Imagine attackers extracting sensitive data without a single click, a user interaction, or even awareness. Mind-blowing, right?

Here's a contrarian take: As we advance AI to perform increasingly complex tasks, are we inadvertently making them the weakest link in our cybersecurity chain? While AI promises incredible efficiencies, these tools might also open doors to new, sophisticated cyber threats.

So, what's the real cost of innovation? As we push AI boundaries, how do we balance innovation with security? Let's rethink our priorities—should the focus shift towards making AI not just smarter, but safer? 🤔 #CyberSecurity #AI #InnovationOrThreat
